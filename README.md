**Build modern and scalable full stack applications using Spring Framework 5 and React with Hooks**

This book covers the following exciting features:
Create a RESTful web service with Spring Boot 
Grasp the fundamentals of dependency injection and how to use it for backend development 
Discover techniques for securing the backend using Spring Security 
Understand how to use React for frontend programming 
Benefit from the Heroku cloud server by deploying your application to it

## Errata

* Page 43: To get the H2 console working you should add the following line in the application.properties file (Use your own folder instead of C:/work):
```
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:C:/work/testdb
```
Now, it creates testdb database file into the folder that you have defined. Then in the console JDBC URL type the following with your own folder:
```
jdbc:h2:file:C:/work/testdb
```

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter10.

The code will look like the following:
```
return (
  <div>
    <Button variant="outlined" color="primary" style={{margin: 10}} onClick={handleClickOpen}>
      New Car
    </Button>
```
